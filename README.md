# GCodeMerger
The goal for this is to make multi-color 3D prints easier on a single extruder  printer. You'll need to slice each color individually, but then you can utilize this program to merge the G-code to be able to print both colors. A pause (customizable) will be injected between filament swaps and the option to enable a primer line (or something idk yet).
